🚀 Programming Fundamentals - Lab 05
📌 Overview:
This repository contains Lab 05 solutions from the Programming Fundamentals course at FAST NUCES Lahore (Fall 2022).
The lab covers bitwise and arithmetic operators in C++.

📂 Topics Covered
✅ Bitwise Operators (&, |, ^, ~, <<, >>)
✅ Arithmetic Operators (+, -, *, /)
✅ Bit Manipulation Techniques
✅ Mathematical Tricks Using Bitwise Operations


📝 Lab Tasks
🟢 Task 01 - Golden Number Conversion
A golden number is a number whose 4th and 2nd bits are 1.
Write a program that takes a number from the user and converts it into its equivalent golden number.

📌 Code: Q1.cpp

📌 Example Input:
  Enter a number: 5

📌 Expected Output:
    Your golden number is: 15

🟢 Task 02 - Remainder Calculation Using Bitwise Operators
Write a program that takes a number from the user and calculates the remainder when divided by 8 using bitwise operators.

📌 Hint:
  The last 3 bits of a number represent its remainder when divided by 8.

📌 Code: Q2.cpp

📌 Example Input:
  Enter a number: 17

📌 Expected Output:
  Remainder: 1



🟢 Task 03 - Mathematical Trick Using Bitwise Operators
Write a program that performs the following steps:
1️⃣ Take an integer input from the user.
2️⃣ Double the value using a bitwise operator.
3️⃣ Add 10 to the value.
4️⃣ Half the value using a bitwise operator.
5️⃣ Subtract the original number from the final value.
6️⃣ The answer must always be 5.

📌 Code: i220970_Q3.cpp

📌 Example Input:
  Enter a number: 7

📌 Expected Output:
  Double: 14
  Added 10: 24
  Halved: 12
  Subtracted 7 = 5

🟢 Task 04 - Single-Digit Sum of a Number
Write a program that adds all digits of a number repeatedly until the result is a single-digit number.

📌 Example Calculation:

  vbnet
  Copy
  Edit
  Input: 48
  Step 1: 4 + 8 = 12
  Step 2: 1 + 2 = 3
  Output: 3
📌 Code: Q4.cpp

📌 Example Input:
  Enter a number: 49

📌 Expected Output:
  4 + 9 = 13
  1 + 3 = 4
  Final Output: 4
